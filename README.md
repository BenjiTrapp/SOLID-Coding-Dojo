# SOLID design principles

This repository contains examples of the five SOLID design principles of object-oriented programming. The examples are written in Java. Each example has a "good" and "bad" version to demonstrate adherence to and violation of the principle, respectively.

|S	|Single responsibility principlea class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)
O	
Open/closed principle[5]
“software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”
L	
Liskov substitution principle[6] 
“objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.
I	
Interface segregation principle[7]
“many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”[8]
D	
Dependency inversion principle[9]
